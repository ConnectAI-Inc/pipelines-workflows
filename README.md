# Gruntwork Pipelines Workflows

These two workflows contain the encapsulated logic for the Gruntwork Pipelines CI/CD system.

They are designed to integrate with the [Gruntwork Pipelines CLI](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/pipelines-cli).

## Workflows

### [pipelines-root.yml](./.github/workflows/pipelines-root.yml)

This workflow handles the CI/CD for deploying updates to infrastructure managed by the DevOps Foundations `infrastructure-live-root` repository.

### [pipelines-delegated.yml](./.github/workflows/pipelines-delegated.yml)

This workflow handles the CI/CD for deploying updates to infrastructure managed by all the other repositories vended as part of DevOps Foundations.
