# GruntCon `pipelines-workflows`

This is a demo repo showing part of the [Pipelines V3 architecture](https://www.notion.so/gruntwork/Pipelines-v3-69db3c6636034cb3bfc72afe235005f4?pvs=4) built during the 2024/02 GruntCon.

The `pipelines-workflows` repo is the repo that contains the shared workflows that are used throughout Gruntwork Pipelines.

It has analogous workflows for those that are present in `infra-pipelines` in the V2 architecture.
